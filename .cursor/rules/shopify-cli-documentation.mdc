# Shopify CLI

Shopify CLI is a command-line interface tool that helps you generate and work with Shopify apps, themes and custom storefronts. You can also use it to automate many common development tasks.

## Requirements


- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): 18.20+, 20.10 or higher
- A Node.js package manager: [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [Yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads): 2.28.0 or higher


## Installation

This installs Shopify CLI globally on your system, so you can run `shopify` commands from any directory. Find out more about the available commands by running `shopify` in your terminal.
```bash
npm install -g @shopify/cli@latest

```

```bash
yarn global add @shopify/cli@latest

```

```bash
pnpm install -g @shopify/cli@latest

```

```bash
# Only for macOS
brew tap shopify/shopify
brew install shopify-cli

```


## Commands


Shopify CLI groups commands into topics. The command syntax is: `shopify [topic] [command]`.
Refer to each topic section in the sidebar for a list of available commands.

Or, run the `help` command to get this information right in your terminal.

```bash
shopify help

```


## Upgrade Shopify CLI

We recommend that you always use the latest version of Shopify CLI if possible. To upgrade, run `version` to check the current version and determine if there are any updates available. Run the [install](#installation) command to upgrade to the latest CLI version.
```bash
shopify version
> Current Shopify CLI version: 3.50.0
> ðŸ’¡ Version 3.51.0 available!

npm install -g @shopify/cli@latest

```


## Usage reporting

Anonymous usage statistics are collected by default. To opt out, you can use the environment variable `SHOPIFY_CLI_NO_ANALYTICS=1`.
